# ActivitiesGallery
Usage examples for the Activities Gallery on Android Studio.

This project just show how to use and integrate the Android Studio's Gallery of Activities.

Started with an Empty Activity.

Then added the Navigation Drawer to link the activities.

Added Blank, Scrolling and Settings activities. 

The Settings Activity has the Up button, so the Navigation Drawer was set as parent.
